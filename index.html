        <h2>ABOUT <span>ME</span></h2>
        <p>I am a passionate and skilled tattoo artist with over 8 years of experience in creating unique, personalized designs.
            I specialize in bringing her clients' visions to life through custom artwork, paying close attention to detail and ensuring a comfortable, collaborative experience.
            My goal is to make every piece not only a work of art but also a meaningful expression for each individual. Whether you're getting your first tattoo or adding to your collection,
            I provide a professional, clean, and welcoming environment.
            I believe that a tattoo is more than just ink on skin; it's a lasting representation of your journey, memories, and values. That’s why I take the time to get to know my clients,
            understanding their stories and inspirations to create designs that truly resonate with them. My commitment to excellence extends beyond the artwork itself—I strive to
            educate my clients about aftercare and the tattoo process, ensuring they feel confident and informed every step of the way.
